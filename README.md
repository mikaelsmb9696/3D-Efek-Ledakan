Install instructions
- Open the project you want to add.

- drag the explosion easy package to the project.

- import all files by pressing the import button.

- after the assets are entered, in the scene where you want to apply easy explosion, open the easy explosion folder, explosion, and drag easy explosion into the scene.

- To test the explosion, we use the example script that has been created in the asset by entering the trigger on touch script.

- then enter the easy explosion object into the trigger on touch inspector.

- To test the trigger on touch script, we create a 3D object for the explosion spawn location.

- if later the user wants to create a script to call their own explosion, the remaining user takes the Explosion Spawner script in the easy explosion object.

- then call the SpawnExplosion function.

- we play and click on the 3D object, then the explosion will immediately spawn on the 3D object.

- if we want to change the explosion type, we only need to open the explosion settings, then change the explosion type.

- In this explosion setting, we can also change several settings such as scale, duration, radius and total explosion sparks.
